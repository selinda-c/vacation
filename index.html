      <h1 class="card-header">The Beauty!</h1>
      <p div class="title">Beyond stunning beaches and magical temples, Bali has virtually every kind of natural beauty.
      </p>
      <img src="img/nature.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Glorious mountainous areas with lush greenery, scenic lakes, gorgeous waterfalls, iconic rice fields, flower gardens, gushing sacred rivers and secret canyons all make up the island’s landscape.There’s an activity for every adventurous soul in Bali. Catch the surf breaks at Bali’s most popular surfing spots or rent a board and start learning to ride the waves. Jump from the cliffs and slide down a natural waterslide in Aling-Aling Waterfall, or enjoy intricate artificial slides and other activities at the Waterbom. Descend into the sea inside a submarine, dive by yourself or experience walking on the seabed. You name it, Bali has it.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h1 class="card-header">The Culture!</h1>
      <p div class="title">The Balinese are spiritual people, predominantly Hindus, and their houses are furnished with a small temple, at which they pray every day. Temple tours are particularly popular among tourists, not only for the religious value but also for cultural insights and aesthetic pleasure. From majestic sea temples overlooking the ocean to a soul-soothing grand temple complex up on the mountain, Bali’s temples shouldn’t be missed.
      </p>
      <img src="img/culture.jpg">
      <p class="subtitle">Bali’s beauty goes way deeper than its beautiful appearances. The island is also home to many traditional cultural traditions that are still practiced. The Balinese hold many ceremonies and celebrations throughout the year, lots of which can be enjoyed by curious tourists, from the Omed-Omedan kissing festival to the monster parade before the day of silence (Nyepi). Tourists can also enjoy Bali’s culture through music, dance and architecture.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h1 class="card-header">The food!</h1>
      <p div class="title">Bali’s rich and fertile soil, and also its fascinating traditional recipes, have created a distinctive cuisine. Bali’s traditional meals can be enjoyed as street food or fine dining, and you can learn how to cook them yourself by taking part in a culinary masterclass in Ubud as part of Culture Trip’s immersive small-group Bali tour. Many international chefs are drawn to Bali to learn, create and modify recipes, resulting in neighbourhoods lined with restaurants, each with their own concepts. Bali also has no shortage of restaurants with international menus — American, Mexican, Greek, Chinese, French, Indian… There are also many restaurants serving organic, vegan or even raw food.</p>

      <p>"We visited Bali in September, and Wayan Sukerta was recommended to us by friends who had used his services several times. We discussed the sort of thing we would like to see (countryside and nature, basically) and left it to Wayan to choose where to take us. His english is excellent btw, and he was very open to our questions about Balinese family life and culture."</p>
